# Flash Beats

As music lovers, we wanted a clean and accurate way to search for our favorite songs to play while also displaying the lyrics. The interface of our application is intuitive - simply type in the name of the artist and song you would like to listen to. You will then have to option listen to the song on YouTube, read the lyrics or search for concert tickets.
